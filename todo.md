# ForestBot Rust Port Remaining TypeScript Parity (``todo.md``)

Only behavior still missing or partial compared to `ForestBot/src` is listed here.

🔎 = Feature/functionality missing that was present in ts forest

🆕 = New feature/functionality

🐛 = Working, needs a bug fix

✅ = Complete

❌ = Rejected

⏸️ = On hold


## Commands

* ✅ ~~`drop`: TypeScript drops the held item or every inventory item via Mineflayer `tossStack`; Rust currently only replies that Azalea inventory-drop parity is not wired.~~
* ✅ ~~`mount` / `ride` / `mush`: TypeScript finds the nearest mountable entity or vehicle, applies cooldowns, and mounts it; Rust currently only replies that mounting is not wired.~~ // `nearest_entities_by` + `EntityRef::interact()` implemented; Azalea has a TODO for full riding state tracking so mount success cannot be confirmed, but the interact packet is sent
* ✅ ~~`sleep`: TypeScript finds and activates a bed; Rust currently only replies that sleeping is not wired.~~ // `find_block` + `ServerboundUseItemOn`; toggle via `BOT_SLEEPING` static; `!sleep`/`!crouch`/`!twerk` all send `StopSleeping` when in bed
* ✅ ~~`twerk` / `bootyshake` / `booty` / `dance`: TypeScript toggles sneak for 10 seconds; Rust command is registered but still needs equivalent Azalea control-state behavior verified.~~ // timing matches TS (100ms interval, 10s duration)
* ✅ ~~`realname`: display_name: Option<String> added to PlayerSnapshot, populated from PlayerInfo.display_name (FormattedText→plain string) on AddPlayer/UpdatePlayer; !realname resolves display name → real username~~
* ✅ `febzey`: ~~Rust has equivalent last-seen-style behavior, but it is not byte-for-byte identical to the TypeScript command text.~~
	* *Working as intended afaik*

## Bot Runtime Behavior

* ✅ ~~Port the TypeScript outgoing message filter except the secondary filter, which is intentionally not planned for the Rust port:~~
  * ~~`useCustomChatPrefix` / `customChatPrefix`~~
  * ~~`json/bad_words.json` profanity filter~~
  * ~~`json/word_whitelist.json`~~
  * ~~`smart_censoring` / Together API censor path~~
  * ~~queued outgoing send behavior~~
* ✅ ~~Port `announce`: TypeScript periodically advertises enabled non-whitelisted command descriptions after spawn.~~
  * ✅ ~~`description: &'static str` added to `CommandDefinition`; all commands have descriptions with `{prefix}` placeholder~~
* ✅ ~~Port `antiafk`: TypeScript starts anti-AFK on spawn when enabled.~~ // tokio::spawn loop on Event::Spawn, cancelled on Event::Disconnect via Arc<AtomicBool>
* ❌ ~~Port `usePViewer` / `pViewerPort`.~~ // prismarine-viewer is Mineflayer-only, no Azalea equivalent
* ✅ ~~Port startup ping/retry behavior from TypeScript `Bot.startBot()`, including the 10-failure long backoff.~~ // consecutive_failures AtomicU32 on AzaleaState; reset on Spawn, increment on ConnectionFailed/Disconnect; 10th failure sleeps 10 min — confirmed working in live test
* ✅ ~~Port TypeScript reconnect lifecycle exactly: `endAndRestart()`, `isConnected`, and explicit bot quit/end handling.~~ // `isConnected` has no consumers; `endAndRestart()` covered by Azalea `.reconnect_after()`; `sendPlayerLeave` WS packet sent on `Disconnect` via `send_session_flush_leave`
* ✅ ~~Port TypeScript logger categories and message wording where runtime parity matters.~~ // Rust has all TS categories; TS `move` category has no callers in either codebase

## Chat Parsing And Message Handling

* ❌ ~~`useLegacyChat` / `messagestr.ts`~~ // Azalea always provides structured chat data; legacy raw-string path is not applicable
* ✅ ~~`useCustomChatFormatParser` — custom format parser now gated on config flag; empty formats vec when disabled~~ // gated in Bot::new(), Bot::start(), and reload.rs
* ✅ ~~Verify Rust whisper parsing covers both TypeScript `whisperFrom.ts` and `whisperTo.ts` cases.~~ // `whisperTo.ts` is a no-op stub; Rust `whisper_parser.rs` covers all 12 TS patterns + extra `PM:` variant

## Events

* ✅ ~~`end.ts`: TypeScript marks the bot disconnected, quits, restarts, logs end args, and sends the bot leave websocket packet.~~ // `isConnected` has no consumers (N/A); quit/restart via Azalea `.reconnect_after()`; reason logged via `logger::kick`/`logger::logout`; leave WS packet via `send_session_flush_leave` on `Event::Disconnect`
* ✅ ~~`kicked.ts` / `error.ts`: Both register as `name: 'kicked'` in TS — log kick reason, call bot.end(). Not handled in Rust.~~ // Rust `Event::Disconnect` logs readable reason + restart message; reconnect handled natively by Azalea `.reconnect_after()`
* ✅ ~~`spawn.ts` extras~~ // anti-AFK + announce wired; robot marker handled via `use_custom_chat_prefix` config; `isConnected` has no consumers in Rust — N/A; `restartCount` covered by `consecutive_failures` reset on spawn
* ✅ ~~`physicsTick.ts`: TypeScript writes `tick_end` packets; confirm whether Azalea truly makes this unnecessary, then either document or port.~~ // TS handler is a no-op stub (only commented-out look-at-entity code)

## Moderation

* ✅ ~~Fully port MC whitelist enforcement beyond command/admin gating~~ // `use_whitelist` toggle matches TS parity; `whitelisted_commands` config field was dead code in TS, dropped from Rust
* ❌ ~~Port TypeScript `anti_spam_cooldown` and `anti_spam_msg_limit`~~ // dead code in TS, never wired; per-command cooldowns with incremental penalties cover the abuse case

# `todo2.md` (jolly is bad at lists)

## General
* ✅ ~~Movement commands, !sleep, and !drop are unimplemented. !mount~~
	* ✅ ~~!twerk does run but it doesn't really match the ts behavior. The bot does dismount things it's riding so it is crouching, probably too fast to be visible when observed. Maybe replace with !crouch where it just does it once?~~
* ✅ ~~**bug** !setpreset doesn't work in /msg~~
	* ~~*Should be working, needs to be tested in prod to confirm, pending hw migration*~~
* ✅ ~~**bug** !oldest and !newest show incorrect dates. !oldest also shows the oldest users ever, while it should only compare the join dates of who's online.~~
* ✅ ~~**bug**(?) don't record redundant advancements (from the queue or ever)~~ // on `send_player_advancement`, lazy-fetch existing advancements for uuid on first encounter, extract `[bracket-key]` (name-change-proof), skip + whisper if duplicate
* ✅ ~~Discord chat bridge~~
	* Bot's own messages now forwarded to bridge (sender == bot path relays if chatbridge enabled + not a command)
	* Hub WS reconnect: `websocket_close` fires `authenticate()` after 5s in forestapi.ts
	* Discord→MC rapid message drops fixed: removed 10s per-user cooldown from messageCreate.ts
	* Blacklisted users still relay through bridge (blacklist only blocks commands, not relay)
* ✅ ~~!servers \<username> (not sure on the name), lists servers forest has data of the player on~~
	* ~~slightly bugged, just needs to break up lists that are too long~~
* ✅ ~~Add cross server functionality to stats commands (this is mostly done, !lk, !ld, !vicitims, !fm, !lm, !ladv, and !top are missing, if this is intentional I can mark this one complete)~~
	*  // !top <stat> all would need hub support.
* ✅ ~~Make faqs backfillable // NEEDS HUB CHANGES~~
* ✅ ~~!delfaq aka !deletefaq, deletes the faq, freeing up the number. Should be done after faqs are backfillable. Should confirm in whisper. // NEEDS HUB CHANGES~~
* ✅ ~~!advancementcount \<advancement>, shows the number of times an advancement has been reached~~
* ✅ ~~!averageping, !ap, shows the average ping of the server as well as best and worst.~~
* ✅ ~~Cooldowns should be cumulative. For example, the initial 10 second cooldown for !q is fine, but if someone quotes again within cooldown * 2 (20 seconds initially) the cooldown should then increase. I'm thinking just 1 extra second (making it 11 seconds until you can run it again, and 22 until the cooldown resets). This punishes over use and repeated use, since even a small cooldown doesn't seem to be enough to dissuade people to chill on the command spam. This concept should also be implemented for !lm, only waaay more aggressive. There should be a 300 second cooldown for last message on an individual user basis with the same "punishment" style increases. People use forest to bypass ignores and this is meant to dissuade that.~~
* ✅ ~~Self censorship~~
* ✅ ~~Whisper that a command is disabled to the player who ran said command~~
* ✅ ~~**bug**: fix discord bug(?) where blacklisted people's messages don't get sent to discord~~ // uuid blacklist check + case-insensitive player lookup before send_minecraft_chat_message in bot.rs
* ✅ ~~**bug**: fix discord bug where it fails to show /playtimegraph for a user without a join date~~ // Hub returns non-array on missing join date; `buildPlaytimeEmbed` now checks `res.ok` + `Array.isArray(graphData)` before processing
* ✅ Nick resolution for nicked players (EssentialsX `/nick`): `nick_cache` (display_name → uuid) populated from PlayerInfo AddPlayer/UpdatePlayer; checked before Mojang API fallback in chat/advancement UUID resolution and all trade commands. Requires server to send PlayerInfo display_name — EssentialsX needs `change-playerlist: true`.
* ✅ ~~pivot from ashcon api to crafty api for username history lookups~~ // `GET https://api.crafty.gg/api/v2/players/{username}` → `data.usernames[].username`; replaced `AshconProfile`/`AshconUsernameHistory` structs with `CraftyPlayerResponse`/`CraftyPlayerData`/`CraftyUsername`
* ✅ ~~need some kind of alert system in discord for bad behavior that requires manual intervention~~ // content_flagged WS event pipeline: craftbot checks !addfaq/!editfaq/!iam/!greeting input against bad_words.json (leet-speak normalized, ASCII-only enforced); sends content_flagged WS event → Hub broadcasts → Discord bot posts to sudo channel
* ✅ ~~!askgod if user gives multi word non god arg, should assume it's a question for the oracle and answer "The Gods have heard you, and they send you their divine wisdom:" followed by a random quote~~ // ctx.args.len() >= 2 early-path before god match; random corpus, 200-char cap
* ✅ ~~!status allows / commands to run~~ // target.starts_with('/') guard added; root cause: enqueue_chat trim_start strips leading space convention
* ✅ ~~announce when players are detected, 10 min cooldown per player.~~ // `handle_player_detection` on Tick; entity_by_uuid check = nametag visible; `seen_player_detections` HashSet + 600s async remove; gated by `playerDetected` disabled_events key
* ✅ ~~custom advancements! — ForestBot announces fake MC-style advancement unlocks triggered by tracked events (deaths, kills, etc.)~~ // Hub `fadv_awards` table + threshold checks in `checkFadv.ts`; WS event `fadvAwards` → craftbot announces public + whispers player; `!fadvs [category]` command shows per-category progress; one-time per player
 * ✅ ~~Change all relevant functionality to be toggleable via config.json~~ // all automatic chat-sending behaviors now gated via `disabled_events` keys; all commands toggleable via `commands` map
 * ✅ ~~extend offlinemsg to do "remindme"~~ // `!remindme`/`!remind` aliases; optional duration `1s2m3h4d`; no duration = next login; timed = background 30s tick fires when online; `!remindme stop` cancels all; `deliver_at: Option<u64>` added to `OfflineMessage`
* ⏸️ casino style games, create ethereal "chips" currency to go along side them, add wagering to `trivia` command. // ON HOLD need feedback from people first.
* ✅ ~~add pearl bot infrastructure~~ // pearlbot binary; Hub WS routing; ForestBot-RS `!pearl`/`!p <slot>` command; UUID whitelist + per-slot chamber config; multi-pearl tracking (HashSet); deployed to prod RefinedVanilla


## !quote
* ✅ ~~Add support for !q <username> <keyword>~~
* ✅ ~~!q <server>, without username specified, shows random quote from specified server~~
* ✅ ~~Missing the basic 10 second cooldown from pre rewrite. (also needs some extra stuff noted in General)~~

## !faq
* ✅ ~~Should pull a random faq if run without an id number, would match pre rewrite.~~

## !top
* ✅ ~~"we need !top slurcount"~~ // `!top slurcount`/`!top slurs`; sums `get_word_occurrence` across all slurs in `slurcount_list.json` per player; cached same as other top stats
* ✅ ~~optimize db calls for efficiency~~ // `top messages`: was N Hub calls → new Hub `GET /top-messages` (single SQL GROUP BY); `top slurcount`: was N×M calls → new Hub `GET /top-slurcount` (single SQL SUM of REGEXP per word); kills/deaths/joins/playtime/trades/rejects already single-call; advancements already uses leaderboard endpoint

## new commands
* ✅ ~~!hardware - shows os and hardware info, aliased to !hw~~
* ✅ ~~!alias - lists aliases of a command~~
* ✅ ~~!crouch — single press/release; !crouch hold crouches for up to 10min, whispers instructions, !crouch releases~~
* ✅ ~~!slurcount, checks a user's message history for slurs and presents a total. Should not count messages that were commands (ie, a player checking another's word count for a slur shouldn't be counted against them)~~ // Hub `/wordcount` updated: whole-word REGEXP, `exclude_commands=true` adds `AND message NOT LIKE '!%'`; slur list in `json/slurcount_list.json` (bare array, populate manually); parallel requests per slur, counts summed
* ✅ ~~!health, display bot's health, hunger, armor stats~~ // whispers `Health: X/20 | Hunger: X/20 (sat: X) | Armor: X | Effects: ...`; mount health skipped (azalea `set_passengers` is a no-op stub)
* ✅ ~~!askgod, logically translate TempleOS's talk to god stuff lol~~ // KJV loaded from godtexts/kjv.txt.gz via flate2; timestamp entropy (subsec_nanos >> 4) picks a random verse; displays [Book chapter:verse] text in public chat, truncated to 240 chars; multi-god support pending more corpus files
	* God's messages are based on source texts, you can ask different gods (ie: `!askgod buddha`) by using different source texts!
* ✅ ~~!equip, so the bot can actually wear armor to show for the !health command~~ // open_inventory, scan slots 9-44 for Equippable (Head/Chest/Legs/Feet), PickupClick pick+place into armor slots 5-8
* ✅ ~~!wiki let's you search wikipedia based on <arg>.~~ // MediaWiki search API → extract API (2-step); posts `[Title] first line...` truncated 200 chars to public chat; 1-min cooldown per player; aliases `!wiki`/`!wikipedia`
* ✅ ~~!news, let's you find headlines from rss feeds.~~ // BBC RSS via `rss` crate; `!news` whispers categories + top stories; `!news <cat>` whispers 5 numbered headlines; `!news [cat] <N>` posts article description + link (tracking params stripped) to public chat
* ✅ ~~!day/!night, reports irl time until it's either day or night in game~~ // listens for `ClientboundSetTime`, stores `total_ticks` in AzaleaState; day=23460–13188, night=13188–23460; converts ticks to m/s real time
* ✅ ~~!urbandictionary, api seems to be at https://api.urbandictionary.com/v0/define?term={TERM}~~ // `list[0]` → strips `[bracket]` links, collapses newlines, truncates 180 chars, appends `(+N/-N)`; public chat; aliases `!urbandictionary`/`!ud`
* ✅ ~~!greeting, users can give themselves a welcome back message that has a 12 hour cooldown~~ // `greeting` + `greeting_last_fired_at` columns on `users` table; fires on join as `"<message>, Username!"`; 12h cooldown via DB timestamp; preview/clear subcommands
* ✅ ~~!minewiki, same behaviour as !wiki, only for the minecraft wiki~~ // same 2-step flow against minecraft.wiki (`/api.php`); public chat; 1-min cooldown per player; aliases `!minewiki`/`!mcwiki`
* ❌ ~~!weather — predict next weather change using Java LCG seed calibration~~ // not feasible: Azalea does not expose server-internal game time; the tick value available via `SetTime` is client-side and drifts from the server's `ServerLevel.random` draw counter, making LCG calibration impossible
* ⏸️ !duel, let's people bet ethereal points then they fight, winner gets the pot. People should be able to place side bets as well, maybe odds can be calculated using k/d stats? // ON HOLD because the extra infrastrucure for this isn't justified in isolation. maybe if casino games get added?
* ✅ ~~!calc, alias !wolframalpha, !wa, sends requests to the wolframalpha public api~~ // LLM API endpoint; `wolfram_app_id` in bot config; parses all labeled sections with priority order (Result→Solution→Derivative→Definite integral→Indefinite integral→Infinite sum→Sum→Limit→Decimal approximation→Property→…), posts `query = answer` truncated to 220 chars; aliases `!calc`/`!wa`/`!wolframalpha`
* ✅ ~~!translate, add support for azure api for translation~~ // Azure AI Translator; `azure_translator_key` + `azure_translator_region` in config; lang optional (default `en`); single-word input checks online players → translates last message; FROM-English blocked (whatlang local detection, 4+ words); aliases `!translate`/`!tr`/`!tl`
* ✅ ~~!trivia / !answer — server trivia round via Open Trivia DB (no key); boolean and MCQ; 15s answer window open to all players; whispers "Answer received!" on submit; public summary at close shows ✓/✗ lists + answer; latecomers whispered answer for 60s after close~~

# Feature Parity: Craftbot vs Tradebot (``TRADEFEATURES.md``)

Tradebot (Discord) is the reference implementation. This tracks what craftbot (Minecraft) is missing.

## Missing entirely

| Feature | Tradebot | Craftbot |
|---|---|---|
| `!report` command | `/report` — trade or user, reason choices | ✅ done — `!report <player> [reason]`; posts to modlogs |
| Warning display in tradestats | Shows warnings with count, reason, date | ~~out of scope~~ |
| Scammer details | Shows reason + who marked + when | ✅ done — public 🚨 warning on trade initiation; `!trades`/`!tradestats` return "trade counts not reported" |
| `confirmed_at` in trade list | Shows relative timestamp | ✅ struct fixed — `confirmed_at: Option<i64>` added |

## Minor display gaps

* ✅ ~~`!trades` hardcoded to show last 3 — tradebot shows all returned by Hub~~
* ✅ ~~`!trades` truncates description at 30 chars~~ — increased to 190 (256 chat limit minus line overhead)

## Already working (no gap)

* ✅ ~~Hub broadcasts `trade_confirmed`/`trade_rejected` WebSocket events on craftbot-side confirms, tradebot's `listenForMcConfirms` catches them and posts to `#verified-trade` — pipeline intact~~
* ✅ ~~Hub broadcasts `report_created` WS event; tradebot `listenForMcReports` posts MC-origin reports to modlogs with action buttons~~
* ✅ ~~Hub broadcasts `scammer_marked`/`scammer_unmarked` WS events; craftbot announces in public chat~~
* ✅ ~~`!link` → `/link` account linking — both sides implemented~~

* ✅ ~~!unlink~~
* ✅ ~~!top trades~~
* ✅ ~~!top rejects~~
* ✅ ~~!scammers~~
* ✅ ~~/scammers~~
* ✅ ~~## Bug "Showing 3 of 5 warnings. Use /warnings for full list."~~
* ✅ ~~## bug: double posting scam mark announcments~~
	fake bug, evil ghost node instance did this
* ✅ ~~## bug: discord is removing scammer mark, but saying they aren't marked as a scammer.~~
	fake bug, evil ghost node instance did this
* ✅ ~~## bug: /link shouldn't work if the craft user is offline~~
* ✅ ~~## revisit bacon's "out of scope, needs Hub changes"~~
